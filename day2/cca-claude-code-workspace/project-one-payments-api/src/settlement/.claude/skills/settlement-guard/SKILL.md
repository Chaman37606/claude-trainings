# Settlement Guard

Before editing settlement code:
1. Identify settlement window, region, and monetary impact.
2. Check whether the change affects T+1/T+2 behavior.
3. Add or update tests for each affected region.
4. Explain rollback risk.
5. Do not touch src/legacy without an AUD ticket.

Return a settlement impact note before proposing code edits.
